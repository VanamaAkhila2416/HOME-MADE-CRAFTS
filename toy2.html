<p>The clay toys are basically made of clay in the process of terracotta making. Different toys are made in the lumps through wheels by hand, sundried and fired in a kiln. After colouring, the products are used for indoor and outdoor decoration.
  Clay is a material that is naturally available from the earth made up of fine-grained minerals like hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates and with few other minerals like iron, alkaline metals, alkali minerals, magnesium, etc. Clay has a tendency to act like plastic as it hardens when baked or dried. India has the finest tradition of making of toys and it dates back to over 5000 years.

<p>Hand knitted products are made by women from local communities. The raw materials include hand-spun vegetable dyed pure wool, machine-spun pure wool, acrylic, and cotton. The toys that give you so much joy are knit by a sisterhood of women in Kuma
  Flat knitting uses two straight needles to make generally two-dimensional (flat) pieces. Flat knitting is usually used to knit flat pieces like scarves, blankets, afghans, and the backs, fronts and arms of sweaters (pullovers).
  Circular knitting (also called "knitting in the round") creates a seamless tube. Knitting is worked in rounds (the equivalent of rows in flat knitting).

<p>Paper toys are constructed in several ways, by folding, as in paper airplanes, paper fortune tellers or Origami, or by cutting, decorating or assembling pieces of paper with glue or tape to create a paper doll or paper model.
  Paper toys date back to ancient times. The history of paper toys can be traced back to the art of origami (or-i-GA-me).The word is based on the Japanese words Ori, which means to fold, and Kami, which means paper. However origami's roots are from China and it spread to Japan somewhere around the sixth century.
